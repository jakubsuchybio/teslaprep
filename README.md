# Tesla Prep

## Delivery day
### Before heading to the Delivery Center:
If you haven't had any contact with a Delivery Advisor/Scheduler since "First Contact," before you drive to pick your car up, call the Tesla delivery location's direct number, and verify that your car is indeed ready to go. There have been reports of people driving hours to pick up their Tesla only to be told their car isn't even in production yet!

1.  Have the Tesla app installed on your smartphone prior to arrival for delivery.
2.  Bring your driverâ€™s license.
3.  If your car will be registered to more than one person, each person on the registration needs to be at the delivery appointment to sign final documents.
4.  Bring written or digital proof of your down payment having been made and the final payment details or financing details.  If you are financing your car, make sure your loan has been funded before you arrive to take delivery and that you have some kind of proof you can provide to Tesla should they ask about it.
5.  Bring a printed insurance card or other proof of insurance that shows your Model 3 is insured.
6.  Since the delivery area where you will inspect your Model 3 may be dark, bring a flashlight.
7.  Bring a USB drive (32gb minimum recommended) to set up [Sentry mode and the dash cam](https://www.tesla.com/support/software-v9#dashcam).

### Arrival at the Delivery Center:
After checking in with a Tesla employee, you'll likely be waiting around for a while. It's rare for a Tesla delivery center to _not_ be busy. Expect to wait for 2 hours or more before you're taken to see your car.

*NOTE: Do not sign final documents, or wire funds, until a full vehicle inspection is completed.*

## Post-inspection:
### Verify post-delivery vehicle records
1.  Ask your delivery specialist to make sure that your car is marked as DELIVERED in Tesla's network. *NOTE: Some owners have reported cars being delivered, but the phone key is disabled the following day. This is due to the car not being marked as "Delivered" in the network.*

2.  Make sure you have copies of all paperwork necessary for good documentation of your purchase, including a copy of your signed purchase agreement (MVPA). If your delivery specialist suggests that you can get your documents electronically on your Tesla account, ask for paper copies you can take with you anyway. Having physical copies with you ensures you will get them.

*Note: Pointing these out before you leave is important but if you only notice something days later, don't worry. Tesla is has a reputation of rectifying these issues either immediately or on your next visit to the service center. If you have a car you're not happy taking away that day, you have every right to decline the handover until the problems are fixed.*
